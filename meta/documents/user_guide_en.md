# SellerLogic Amazon Lost & Found

Besides damaged, lost, destroyed, and not returned items, there are many other FBA errors that are frequently not visible to Amazon sellers. You cannot manage what you cannot see. As such, claims for refund remain undetected. Lost & Found by SellerLogic provides a solution. This intelligent system uncovers claims for refund that remain undetected normally. Some errors can be reported and reimbursed retroactively for up to 18 months. But there is more. If Amazon does not agree to the refund immediately, we will assist you. 

## Nobody “packed” perfect! 

Amazon fulfilment centre employees are involved in many complex logistics processes, with enormous time and effectiveness pressures. Goods management systems, booking systems, payment systems and transport systems perform work steps during, before and after; customers receive items and return items. Errors cannot be avoided in such complex processes. FBA errors can happen, but they must not remain undetected.

Uncomplained FBA errors are causing a lot of money to be lost  FBA errors are difficult to identify without intelligent automation or a very high amount of effort. As a rule, there is no know-how and time to manually analyse every small detail, merge the necessary reports and interpret errors. Determining the number of errors and all claims for refund in a comprehensive and usable manner requires analysing and compiling up to ten Amazon reports every day. In day-to-day business, this usually takes too much time for Amazon sellers. Sellers lose a lot of money when they are unable to claim the refunds they are entitled to. This way, medium-sized traders using FBA lose up to several thousand euros per year.  A complex system with easy operation
A structured and self-explanatory presentation with all relevant information enables fast and efficient processing. The claims found are explained and documented in detail. Before you submit the case to Amazon, you will be able to fully understand the issue and the expected amount of reimbursement. The content is ready for copying and only needs to be transferred to SellerCentral. This creates the best conditions for a well-founded case opening. By partially automating the process, you do not only save valuable time, but money, as well. With Lost & Found, SellerLogic offers a unique service that you, as customer, can only profit from.
